# :page_facing_up: A Vanilla PHP Todo list

### Usage

First create a database named todo_db but it's up to you if you want another name, just change the config for your environment on config/database.php

```php

$host = "localhost";
$database_name = "todo_db";
$username = "username";
$password = "password";

```

Then, hit this command in the terminal (Current working directory):

```bash
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000
```

Open 127.0.0.1:8000/migrate.php in the browser then go back to index.php.
